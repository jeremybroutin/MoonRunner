# MoonRunner
MoonRunner is a running assistant that helps a user to track his current run, knows the runned distance as well as its pace in meters per seconds.  
Once save a run summary is displayed to user, with the velocity of each segment of run color coded on a map snapshot. Based on the distance and speed, the user can earn badges which are composed of a silver and a gold status (still based on historical performance). The next available badge is actively displayed in the run tracker and a sound is played to notify the user of its success.
